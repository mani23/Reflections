When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
if we are working from some other computer or if we want to share our work with other people, so that they can also access it or correct it.

Copy the HTTPS URL, not the SSH URL!

At 1:29, Caroline copies the URL to the repository. The video mistakenly shows the URL to use if the repository is accessed over SSH. The course assumes that the student will use HTTPS, not SSH. Please click on the HTTPS button and copy the URL that shows up for HTTPS. It will begin with https:// rather than git@github.com.

If you are interested in using SSH instead, you can follow the instructions here, but this is not recommended unless you are already familiar with SSH keys.

Sharing your reflections

We encourage you to be bold in sharing your reflections on GitHub. If you're not happy with any of your responses, the best solution is to update that response in one or more new commits. The previous response will still be visible in the commit history, but updating your perspective over time is part of the learning process! Having a commit history that shows your updating perspective will reflect well on you, not poorly.

That said, if you've written anything in your reflections repository that you are not comfortable sharing, you can checkout the commit before you introduced that change, create a new branch at that point, and commit any other changes you are willing to share to the new branch. Then, by only pushing your new branch, you can keep the changes on your original branch private.
