How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
---------------

1. it was easier to locate the bug, considering I don't have to worry abt all the spell-check, command check and any kind of syntax-error.
2. I didn't have to continuously go through both the files, jumping from one file to another, scrolling both at the same time in both directions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
---------------
    
    A history of a file will show me, where I was confident and right about a certain thing from beginning and others, where i was continuously trying, improvising. Those area may require a few videos or article to clear up my doubts.

    Also, seeing all that I tried will help me in future to choose which version of programming was doing what to my code and project.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
---------------

 Pros
 -----

 1. You can control when and how much to save, so that you don't have much of cluttered history to go through.


 Cons
 ----
 1. You have to remember each and everytime to manually commit.
 2. If there is a reason when you are unable to do that all your work will be gone.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
----------------

  That is a super awesome feature because in projects normally multiple files work together to make a project run. Everytime going on each of those files, which are interconnected could be really tedious.

  Half of the efforts are saved if the changes made in one file are done in others to concurrently and also they are saved simultaneously.

  Otherewise, opening, saving and closing them could take a lot of time and lot of efforts.
  So, I think Git is more for coders who will be more beneficial because of these features and so they have provided saving multiple files in one commit as a feature.

  While the others, like Google Docs etc are more used by a common man and for them it is okay to save the one file they are using to be saved at that  period of time, giving them the control.

=========

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-------------

 Git log is the command used to generate all the commits ever made. From this we can choose which version of the commit we want to see or compare. 
 Git diff is used to make comparisons between two commits.
 So, first we can use Git log to get the id of the two commits we want to compare. Secondly, we can use Git diff to compare those two commit and get the information required e.g. how many lines were added or removed & what was edited.

=========

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
-------------

    Knowing that we would not harm our project in experimenting with a few new things and also, that we will be able to revert back and not start from scratch, gives a lot of confidence and boost our moral to try new things without getting scared of loosing the track.

==========

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
-------------

    version control....editing, saving different versions of my file....My Project
